        <h4>Wallace</h4>
        <summary>A multi-sourcing summarization and reporting
        system.</summary>
        <p>Wallace is a summarization tool designed for data analysis that
        bridges multiple databases based on a constraint.</p>
        <p>As a motivating example of where Wallace fits in, imagine you
        have a database where you write event data based on interactions
        with a website. This is a *lot* of data.<p>
        <p>Every so often, an ETL job sweeps through and
        writes that event data to an optimized data warehouse.
        However, the SLA on the warehouse is 24 hours, and you want
        summaries starting from 3 hours back.</p>
        <p>With Wallace, you can declare this constraint, and Wallace will
        run the queries for the appropriate range against each data
        store, aggregate the results, and write the data to the specified
        summary table.<p>
